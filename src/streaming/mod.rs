/// install pattern is "use the system FFmpeg" — installed via winget,
/// Homebrew, apt, dnf, pacman, etc. The setup wizard guides the user
/// to install it via their OS package manager and refuses to proceed
/// without it. This eliminated an entire class of path-resolution
/// bugs (the v0.1.20-v0.1.33 saga where cwd-relative `./data` would
/// shadow the actual install directory) and dropped ~150 MB of
/// download-then-extract complexity from setup.
///
/// 1. **Well-known absolute paths** (Linux/macOS only) — handles the
///    "works in my shell but not as a service" trap where systemd
///    runs with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin and a brew-installed `ffmpeg` at
///    `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` becomes invisible.
/// 2. **System PATH** (the canonical answer everywhere) — bare
///    `name`, Windows resolves via PATHEXT and the standard search
///    order; Linux/macOS uses standard PATH.
