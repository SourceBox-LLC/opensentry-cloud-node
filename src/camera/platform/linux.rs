//! Linux camera detection using v4l2 API
//!
//! Scans for USB cameras on Linux systems by checking /dev/video* devices.
//!
//! ## Why this is more than "list /dev/videoN"
//!
//! On modern Linux kernels (≥5.x), each UVC USB camera registers
//! **multiple** `/dev/videoN` nodes — typically one for video capture
//! and a sibling node for V4L2 metadata (`V4L2_CAP_META_CAPTURE`).
//! Some drivers register even more (e.g. a separate node for the
//! ISP/encoder pipeline).  The result is that a single physical
//! camera can appear as 2–4 device nodes.
//!
//! If we naively treat every `/dev/videoN` as a camera and hand it to
//! FFmpeg, the metadata-only nodes blow up at stream-start with
//! cryptic exit codes (231, 240) because there's no video stream
//! there to read — see the production incident on the Raspberry Pi
//! where 2 physical USB cameras showed up as 4 entries with half of
//! them stuck in `failed: FFmpeg`.
//!
//! Four filters fix it (see [`LinuxDetector::detect_cameras`]):
//!   1. **Capability check** — `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` must report
//!      `V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE`.  Excludes metadata-only siblings.
//!   2. **M2M reject** — drop nodes that set `V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_M2M` or
//!      `V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_M2M_MPLANE`.  These are codecs/transformers
//!      that need a frame pushed in before they emit one — FFmpeg
//!      can't capture from them and dies with EINVAL.
//!   3. **Driver blacklist** — Raspberry Pi's `bcm2835-isp` and
//!      `bcm2835-codec` drivers register single-direction capture
//!      nodes (so the M2M check doesn't catch them) but they're
//!      ISP/codec processing pipelines, not real camera sources.
//!      They load by default on Pi OS even with no CSI camera
//!      attached, so we have to filter them by driver name.
//!   4. **bus_info dedup** — multiple capture-capable nodes from the
//!      same physical USB device collapse to one entry; the kernel
//!      orders these such that the lowest videoN is canonical.

// which evaluate the same on x86_64, aarch64, and armv7.
