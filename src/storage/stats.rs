//! Filesystem-aware storage stats.
//!
//! `StorageStats` is the snapshot CloudNode reports to Command Center on
//! every heartbeat: how much of the configured cap (`max_size_gb`) we've
//! used, plus how much free / total space the underlying filesystem has.
//! Command Center renders a per-node usage bar from these numbers and
//! warns the operator if the host disk itself is filling up.
//!
//! There's also a hard-floor recording-pause that fires when the host
//! filesystem drops below `SAFETY_FLOOR_BYTES` — independent of the
//! operator's `max_size_gb`.  The cap protects CloudNode against
//! growing past its allocation; the safety floor protects the *host*
//! against CloudNode filling its disk.  Without the floor, an operator
//! who sets `max_size_gb` larger than the disk can hold will eventually
//! hit `ENOSPC` and SQLite (or worse, every other process on the box)
//! breaks.
//!
//! The pause is a process-wide AtomicBool so the recording writer can
//! check it on the hot path without taking a lock.  Updated by
//! `StorageStats::collect` which runs from the heartbeat task tick
//! (every 30s by default).
