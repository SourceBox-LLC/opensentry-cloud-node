//! FFmpeg supervisor.
//!
//! Wraps a per-camera `HlsGenerator` with a loop that:
//!   * polls FFmpeg's exit status every `POLL_INTERVAL`
//!   * when the child exits, respawns it with exponential backoff
//!     (1s, 2s, 4s, …, capped at 30s — matches the WS reconnect backoff)
//!   * bails (→ `Failed`) after too many restarts in a 60s window, so a
//!     permanently broken camera / FFmpeg config / disk-full situation
//!     doesn't spin forever
//!   * watches the uploader's `stall_flag` and kills a wedged-but-alive
//!     FFmpeg so it routes through the same restart path.  Without this,
//!     a pipeline that stops producing segments but keeps the child
//!     process alive (V4L2 deadlock, thermal throttle below real-time,
//!     USB bandwidth starvation) would sit wedged forever and `try_wait`
//!     would never return an exit status to trip the restart loop.
//!   * pushes `CameraStatus::Streaming / Restarting / Failed` into the
//!     Dashboard so the WS + HTTP heartbeats report real pipeline state
//!     instead of the old hardcoded `"streaming"`.
//!
//! Prior to this supervisor, an FFmpeg crash (e.g. a disk-full errno -28,
//! a closed V4L2 fd, a segment-writer failure) would silently leave the
//! camera offline from the browser's point of view while the node still
//! reported `status: streaming` in every heartbeat. The backend MCP
//! tools would then tell users "update CloudNode to latest version"
//! when the real failure was upstream in FFmpeg.
